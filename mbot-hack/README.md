Thanks to xenjee and to Charles McKnight (@chuckmcknight) for his book: A Gentle Introduction To Robotics With mBlock and mBot
They reproduced a mBlock3 file close to the default program of the mBot.

I gave his original file Multi_Programs_v03b.sb2 74 (76.2 KB) 
from https://forum.makeblock.com/t/source-code-for-the-default-program/1526/16
and the Arduino IDE file from the mBot default program

Then I modified and simplified them in order to get all functions of the IR working as the IR default program of the library did not work for me.
Infrared_remote control.sb2   is for mBlock3
Infrared-allKeys.ino is for Arduino
