The aim of the class is to create a robot controlled by the serial interface.

Let's first understand how the serial interface works with BuzzerTest.ino
Then instead of sound, let's make the mBot moves with MbotSerialControl.ino

Finally, let's control the Mbot with the keyboard so that it can move around
and do "special moves"

Then use the 2 sensors, the ultrasonic sensor (with the example: UltrasonicSensorTest)
in order to 
stop/rotate/go backward... 
the mbot if it goes to close to an obstacle.

Finally use the Infrared sensor to make your own limits to the mBot!!
