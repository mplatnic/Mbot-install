The Me 3-Axis Accelerometer and Gyro Sensor is an ideal module for motion and posture detection of robot. It includes a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis angular velocity sensor, and a motion processor, and provides I2C port for communication. It can be applied on the self-balancing cart, 4-axis aircraft, robot, and mobile devices. It has the advantage of high-dynamic measurement range and low current consumption. Its white ID means that it’s in I2C communication mode and should be connected to the port with white ID on Makeblock Orion.
